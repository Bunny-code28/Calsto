I tried to implement a price prediction model which is some what successfull

It Predicts stock prices using sentiment analysis and Markov chains but it is not a foolproof implementation
It Incorporates news sentiment via NewsAPI which is then rated wai a set of point system which uses NLP

#HOW TO USE
1) NewsAPI key WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM newsapi.org
2) enter the stock symbol
